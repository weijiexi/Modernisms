# Modernisms
## European modernism: 1860s – 1960s
- Industrialization:
- First Industrial Revolution: 1760s
- Second Industrial Revolution: 1850s
    - Growth of cities; large-scale factories; inventions of the cotton gin, sheet glass, steam
    power, cement, iron, steel, gas lighting, building of ships, railways, and roads;
    - Changes in social relations, ending of feudal systems, and growth of a middle-class,
    wider patronage of the arts;
    - inventions in photography (Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1922/26; Louis-Jacques-Mandé
    Daguerre (glass plate), 1839; William Henry Fox Talbot (paper negative), 1839...);
    - invention of paint tubes (1841);
    - Scientific inventions and changing ideas;
    - The spread of secular thought;
### Let’s reconsider the formation of ‘European modernism’ in relation to and as extractive from its colonies:
- Industrialization:
    -  Wealth developed from slavery;
    -  Wealth developed from raw materials from colonies;
    -  Industrialization concentrated in Europe by de-industrializing other regions (through
    taxes, removal of raw materials, trade treaties, sanctions, wars)
    -  Development of shipping industries;
    -  Growth of port cities connected to shipping (gold, silver, slaves, cotton, spices, ores,
    wood, etc);
    -  Migration to port cities and across seas;
    -  Wealth used to create museums to house and display colonial artefacts;
    -  Wider patronage of the arts, museums and salons to display art to the public;
    -  Artists traveling to different colonized countries (Gauguin, Pechstein, Matisse, ...)
    -  Artists gaining access to artefacts from around the world (Rousseau, Picasso...)
### Societal changes create different social ideas, understandings, and desires:
- The rise of the middle classes (the bourgeoisie);
- theories of social relations through economies:
    - Adam Smith (The Wealth of Nations, 1776, capitalism and the division of labor)
    - Karl Marx (Das Kapital, 1867-1883, analysis of capital and development of communism and socialism)
- theories of social relations through biology (Charles Darwin, On the Origin of
Species,1859);
- theories of social relations through psychology (Sigmund Freud: psychoanalysis,
dreams, repression, the unconscious, sexuality, the Id, Ego, etc)
- The conflict of class (away from monarchy and towards the middle and working classes)
- The idea that Europe had run its course/the search elsewhere for new forms
    -  Orientalism; primitivism
- The influence of urban life and technology
- The trajectory away from depicting history
    - away from mythology
    - away from naturalism and realism
- The trajectory towards depicting the present, and its many changes
    - towards experimentation
    - towards the new
    - towards flatness
    - towards abstraction
- Impressionism (France) 1860s (the breakdown of the image through color); Pointillism,
1886, develops out of Impressionism,
- Expressionism (expressing the artist’s inner feelings), beginning in early 1900s
    - German expressionism: Die Brucke (The Bridge), 1905-13
    - German expressionism: Die Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), 1912-14
- Fauvism (France), approx. 1905-1910, (the expansion of color)
- Cubism (Paris) (the breakdown of form)
- Constructivism (Russia), 1915, art In service to revolution
- Suprematism (Russia), 1913 (“the supremacy of pure artistic feeling” Kasimir Malevich)
- Surrealism (interiority, dreams, and the influence of Sigmund Freud’s The Interpretation of
Dreams, 1899; and later, Carl Jung’s ideas of archetypes and the “collective unconscious”)
- Futurism (Italy), 1909-1918
- Found materials, collage, assemblage (Paris, Germany) and the Readymade (New York)
- Abstract Expressionism (New York), 1940s – 1950s
### Modernist ideas
- Art should be physically and emotionally experienced; it shouldn’t convey information or be
narrative in the sense of telling the viewer something.
- An emphasis on progress and linear development (one thing leads to or causes another); or
one thing replaces another.
- An emphasis on originality;
- An emphasis on individual genius (often working in isolation)
- Inspiration (rather than influence, learning, and collective ideas)
- Artistic interiority (working from “within” rather than the influence of culture)
- Art cannot be taught, or learned
- A belief that art reveals (eternal) truth
- Art transcends time
- Art is good for us
- All these ideas get challenged from within modernism itself
### New York Modernism
#### D.T. SUZUKI (1870–1966), writes Richard M. Jaffe, was “one of the most culturally influential Asians - In a seven-decade globe-trotting career, Suzuki almost single-handedly introduced Zen to the West while promoting the preservation of Buddhism in Asia.
- He became the world’s foremost authority on the subject, the most
identifiable representative of Japanese culture, and even a spokesperson for Asians generally in the Western, white maledominated world of intellectuals.
- Then in 1956, pocket-sized paperback editions of his Englishlanguage writings brought the 86-year-old Suzuki celebrity status.
- With Martin Heidegger, Carl Jung, John Cage, and the Beats among the countless artists, scholars, and seekers who admired him, Suzuki had a huge impact on 20th-century global thought.
#### A decade after World War II, a new culture was emerging, one in which waves of products targeted at a growing class of consumers were advertised on TV, in magazines and newspapers, and on larger-than-life billboards.
- Artists around the world were inspired by this explosion of mass media and began to
use it as source material, repurposing commercial images and depicting familiar
subjects, from everyday objects to the stars and stories that populated the front page.
- Yet there was no single approach: artists both celebrated and criticized the era’s surge
of consumerism.
- In 1957, the British artist Richard Hamilton tried to summarize these new tendencies
by coining the term “Pop Art,” describing it to friends as “Popular (designed for a mass
audience), Transient (short-term solution), Expendable (easily forgotten), Low cost,
Mass produced, Young (aimed at youth), Witty, Sexy, Gimmicky, Glamorous, Big
Business.”
#### Post WWII:
- Migration:
   - Political, economic, and war refugees; Jewish diaspora; Artists and
intellectuals
   - Continuing migration from the US South
- Growth of industry and consumerism
- New social relations:
   - Embracing consumerism; Rejecting consumerism
   - Civil Rights
   - 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act (removing some legal discriminations)
   - Black Power (eg Black Panther Party, Oakland, 1966)
   - Chicano Movement (, 1940s + 1960s-70s
   - American Indian Movement, Minneapolis, 1968)
   - Asian American movement (eg. Asian American Political Alliance, Berkeley,1968)
   - The Beats; Hippies
   - 2 nd-wave Feminism (1960s to 1980s)
   - 1969, Stonewall, Gay Liberation Front (named in reference to the Algerian
National Liberation Front, and the Vietnamese National Liberation Front.
##### PROMPTS
- Where do you see yourself, your history, experience, ideas, and work in
this history of modernism or in what follows it?
- If you don’t see yourself within it as so far described, are there points,
ideas, forms where you feel you could insert yourself or intervene to
shift modernism’s directions or fill in some of its gaps?
