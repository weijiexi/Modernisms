# Modernisms
## European modernism: 1860s – 1960s
- Industrialization:
- First Industrial Revolution: 1760s
- Second Industrial Revolution: 1850s
    - Growth of cities; large-scale factories; inventions of the cotton gin, sheet glass, steam
    power, cement, iron, steel, gas lighting, building of ships, railways, and roads;
    - Changes in social relations, ending of feudal systems, and growth of a middle-class,
    wider patronage of the arts;
    - inventions in photography (Joseph Nicéphore Niépce, 1922/26; Louis-Jacques-Mandé
    Daguerre (glass plate), 1839; William Henry Fox Talbot (paper negative), 1839...);
    - invention of paint tubes (1841);
    - Scientific inventions and changing ideas;
    - The spread of secular thought;
### Let’s reconsider the formation of ‘European modernism’ in relation to and as extractive from its colonies:
- Industrialization:
    -  Wealth developed from slavery;
    -  Wealth developed from raw materials from colonies;
    -  Industrialization concentrated in Europe by de-industrializing other regions (through
    taxes, removal of raw materials, trade treaties, sanctions, wars)
    -  Development of shipping industries;
    -  Growth of port cities connected to shipping (gold, silver, slaves, cotton, spices, ores,
    wood, etc);
    -  Migration to port cities and across seas;
    -  Wealth used to create museums to house and display colonial artefacts;
    -  Wider patronage of the arts, museums and salons to display art to the public;
    -  Artists traveling to different colonized countries (Gauguin, Pechstein, Matisse, ...)
    -  Artists gaining access to artefacts from around the world (Rousseau, Picasso...)
### Societal changes create different social ideas, understandings, and desires:
- The rise of the middle classes (the bourgeoisie);
- theories of social relations through economies:
    - Adam Smith (The Wealth of Nations, 1776, capitalism and the division of labor)
    - Karl Marx (Das Kapital, 1867-1883, analysis of capital and development of communism and socialism)
- theories of social relations through biology (Charles Darwin, On the Origin of
Species,1859);
- theories of social relations through psychology (Sigmund Freud: psychoanalysis,
dreams, repression, the unconscious, sexuality, the Id, Ego, etc)
- The conflict of class (away from monarchy and towards the middle and working classes)
- The idea that Europe had run its course/the search elsewhere for new forms
    -  Orientalism; primitivism
- The influence of urban life and technology
- The trajectory away from depicting history
    - away from mythology
    - away from naturalism and realism
- The trajectory towards depicting the present, and its many changes
    - towards experimentation
    - towards the new
    - towards flatness
    - towards abstraction
- Impressionism (France) 1860s (the breakdown of the image through color); Pointillism,
1886, develops out of Impressionism,
- Expressionism (expressing the artist’s inner feelings), beginning in early 1900s
    - German expressionism: Die Brucke (The Bridge), 1905-13
    - German expressionism: Die Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider), 1912-14
- Fauvism (France), approx. 1905-1910, (the expansion of color)
- Cubism (Paris) (the breakdown of form)
- Constructivism (Russia), 1915, art In service to revolution
- Suprematism (Russia), 1913 (“the supremacy of pure artistic feeling” Kasimir Malevich)
- Surrealism (interiority, dreams, and the influence of Sigmund Freud’s The Interpretation of
Dreams, 1899; and later, Carl Jung’s ideas of archetypes and the “collective unconscious”)
- Futurism (Italy), 1909-1918
- Found materials, collage, assemblage (Paris, Germany) and the Readymade (New York)
- Abstract Expressionism (New York), 1940s – 1950s
### Modernist ideas
- Art should be physically and emotionally experienced; it shouldn’t convey information or be
narrative in the sense of telling the viewer something.
- An emphasis on progress and linear development (one thing leads to or causes another); or
one thing replaces another.
- An emphasis on originality;
- An emphasis on individual genius (often working in isolation)
- Inspiration (rather than influence, learning, and collective ideas)
- Artistic interiority (working from “within” rather than the influence of culture)
- Art cannot be taught, or learned
- A belief that art reveals (eternal) truth
- Art transcends time
- Art is good for us
- All these ideas get challenged from within modernism itself
