# Geometric Abstraction - Suprematism
Suprematism is an art movement founded by Russian artist Kazimir Malevich in the early 20th century, around 1913. It focuses on pure abstraction, emphasizing the supremacy of geometric forms and the use of color to convey emotional expression. Malevich developed the theory that the essence of art lies in its ability to transcend representation and reach a universal, spiritual state.
- Suprematism is characterized by the use of basic geometric forms, primarily squares, rectangles, circles, and lines.
- Malevich's famous work, Black Square (1915), exemplifies the movement's focus on reducing art to its most fundamental elements.
- The movement was concerned with the idea that abstraction, through geometric forms and colors, could express universal truths and deeper spiritual meanings.
- Suprematism rejects representation, aiming instead for a direct experience of color and shape, intended to convey emotion and transcendence.
